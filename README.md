AutoVOD 1.0
Created by Sage Severson


Instructions:

1) Ensure OBS is installed

2) Download Python 3.11 using link below (Will not work with anything newer than 3.11 currently)!!

	https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe

	I) Install in default path
	II) MAKE SURE TO CHECK "Add python.exe to PATH (VERY IMPORTANT)



3) Creating Google OAuth Key:


*This is required by Google. Will ask for some details such as contact email but since you won't share this project this won't be relevant.*



	I) Go to Enable APIs and Services

	II) Enable YouTube Data API v3

	III) Find and click create Credentials

		a) Credential Type:

			YouTube Data API v3

			User Data (OAuth client)
			
		b) OAuth Client ID

			Application Type-- Desktop App

			Name: OBS Uploader



	IV) Download your credentials


	V) Go to Audience tab
		a) Create test user

		b) Add email you're using for Youtube uploading 



	*If it asks you to configure a consent screen first:*



	VI) Click Configure consent screen

		-- Fill in just the bare minimum --

		a) Choose External (if prompted)

		b) App name: OBS Auto Uploader

		c) User support email: Your email

		d) Developer contact email: Your email

		e) Save/continue through until you can return to Credentials.



	VII) Rename credentials file to: client_secret.json


	VIII) Put file in C:\OBS_AutoUploader



4) Run install_dependencies.bat in the OBS_AutoUploader root folder

5) Run FinalCheck.bat in the OBS_AutoUploader root folder. Take note to not run FinalCheck.py by accident

	I) This will check that the proper py files, secret_client.json file, and tests if Youtube authentication succeeds.
	II) For first time setup, this will launch google cloud console and ask for permission. If this fails, ensure you have set up your email as a test user in step 3.
	III) Once this succeeds, this will create a pickle file in the root folder. This allows you to use the application without asking for permission in the future.

6) Open OBS and go to Tools --> Scripts
	
	I) In python settings, browse and find the root folder of python 3.11
	II) Ensure OBS says "Loaded Python version 3.11"
	III) Restart OBS to ensure changes took place

7) In your main OBS scene (the one you’ll record from), create these Text (GDI+) sources:

	P1_Name
	P2_Name
	Round (Winners Finals, Grands, etc.)
	Tournament (Manoa Monthlies 99, West Side Smash 45, etc.)
	Character 1
	Character 2

	*Character fields can be left blank if not wanted. 

	** These are what the script reads to build the title / description.
	*** If your overlay already has labels, you can just rename those sources

8) In OBS, go to Tools --> Scripts and add the obs_trigger.py script located in the OBS_AutoUploader root folder

9) Look at Script description on right side of window. ENABLE auto-upload and fill out fields:

	I)  Python.EXE location (Most likely C:\Users\h4seves22a\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311)
	II) location youtube_uploader.py (OBS_AutoUploader root folder)
	III) Do NOT fill out text fields. These will be auto-generated by the script
	IV) Press close
	

10) Test script via short recording

11) Finished!!! Enjoy :)
